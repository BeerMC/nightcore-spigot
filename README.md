## About
![](https://repo.nightexpressdev.com/api/badge/latest/releases/su/nightexpress/nightcore/nightcore?color=40c14a&name=nightcore&prefix=v)

**nightcore** is a lightweight all-in-one library-engine plugin that contains a lot of useful utilities, APIs, frameworks, wrappers and frequently used code. It was created to reduce amount of duplicated code in plugins, make plugin creation less annoying and more faster. All nightcore's features are thoroughly tested and highly optimized. The nightcore itself has no impact on server's performance, it doesn't handle or store any data.

All nightcore based plugins are clean and lightweight. There is no metrics, update checkers, data collectors, DRM systems or advertisements.
